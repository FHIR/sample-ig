		<h1>Questionnaire content</h1>
		<p>Normally this would be a Questionnaire with active input controls, a 'submit' button at the end and embedded Javascript that would (securely) transmit the content of the completed form to some desired end location.  However, HL7 publication rules have tight guidelines on the use of Javascript and other active controls, so no functional example is provided.  This example should, however, still indicate how an arbitrary HTML page that could be rendered in a local browser could be transmitted using the SDC $populate-html operation.</p>
